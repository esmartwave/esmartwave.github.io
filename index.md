# A little about me

My expertise lies in aligning people, technology and core values to create frictionless, secure work experiences and improve team effectiveness. I have spent most of my career bridging the gap between technology and the people who benefit from its thoughtful implementation. I believe alignment of people, processes and systems can produce powerful results in organizations. I look forward to the chance to grow something together.
