# Standard Professional Resume Template


GOOD TIPS
* Keep sentences to 25 words or less. 
* Keep paragraphs to three lines or less.
* Keep your resume to 2 pages. Only the last 2-3 jobs and their detail are what folks are likely to focus on.
* Tell your story with fact and ojectivity. Let your personality shine through in the cover letter, your introduction and your interviews.
* Use correct grammar and punctuation (know the correct use of commas, colons, semicolons)
* Don't abbreviate something the first time it shows up in your text. Spell it out and then put the abbreviation in parenthesis first, then you can use the abbreviation the rest of the doc.
* 

* The ATS, which may have automated filters and workflows and might rank you without a human seeing your resume
* The Recruiter, who may have to look through 100-300 resumes before they get to yours (unless you have a diret referral). Based on that, you can assume 
* The Hiring Manager
* Any other interviewers
